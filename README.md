# My AOC 2021 answers in Haskell 

## Please don't look at this repo as it is a mess at its current state ðŸ˜…

This is a cabal project - depends upon the matrix pkg (`cabal install matrix`), and is run with `cabal run`

At the current state I haven't published any binaries

Change puzzle input from `./input` accordingly

All Haskell code answers are located in `./src`

Change Haskell file to be run from `AOC2021.cabal` `main-is` (e.g. to `Day2.hs`), and in that respective file uncomment `module Main where`
